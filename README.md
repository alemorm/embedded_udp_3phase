# UDP Communication Sample Project on Embedded Systems (Raspberry Pi)

## Description

Testing User Datagram Protocol (UDP) communications on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. The Raspberry Pi sends simulated 3-phase power data to another device in a Local Area Network through an UDP port and the data is visualized real-time using Python.

## Development

The UDP communications on the Raspberry Pi are sent using C and received using Python on the target device. The development is done remotely using a VSCode compound task toolchain with rsync and ssh for compilation.
